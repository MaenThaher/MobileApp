## React Native && Expo

### REACT NATIVE

Well, the only experience I have with React Native is when I was PR reviewing some 'social justice' developers that help us develop A Ween Rayeh

Yes, the developers DID NOT like me.

But anyways, it's pretty easy to go from react to react native, once you know how to convert the components and deal with quirks of navigation, context & styling

Did read a few docs before starting, and asked the AI for some tips too & to give me a cheat sheet to go from React to React Native, which will be a huge help
